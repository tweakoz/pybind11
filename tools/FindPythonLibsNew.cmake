# - Find python libraries
# This module finds the libraries corresponding to the Python interpreter
# FindPythonInterp provides.
# This code sets the following variables:
#
#  PYTHONLIBS_FOUND           - have the Python libs been found
#  PYTHON_PREFIX              - path to the Python installation
#  PYTHON_LIBRARIES           - path to the python library
#  PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS        - path to where Python.h is found
#  PYTHON_MODULE_EXTENSION    - lib extension, e.g. '.so' or '.pyd'
#  PYTHON_MODULE_PREFIX       - lib name prefix: usually an empty string
#  PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES       - path to installation site-packages
#  PYTHON_IS_DEBUG            - whether the Python interpreter is a debug build
#
# Thanks to talljimbo for the patch adding the 'LDVERSION' config
# variable usage.
